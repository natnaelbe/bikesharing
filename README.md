## We are analyzing bike data based on daily activity done by both genders. These visualizations can be represented in various ways.
## For sheet 1, there appeared to be a higher demand of male subscribers on bikes compared to customers.
## For the next sheet, there appeared to be a higher demand of bikers for the first entry but it declined as time progressed.
## Consequently, there appeared to be a higher demand of male riders compared to female riders.
## For the following visualization, there appeared to be a maximum amount of riders between the hrs of 5 and 6 PM on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.
## For the final visualization, there appeared to be a higher demand of male riders compared to female riders between the hrs of 6-9 AM and 5-6 PM.
## It seems men outweigh women when it comes to the amount of riders. I would have a different display of colors for stories 1,4, and 5 along with an extra category for story 1 - perhaps labeled tourists.
